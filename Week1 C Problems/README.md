# ðŸ’» CS50x Week 1 â€“ C Programming

This folder contains my solutions to the CS50x Week 1 problem set. These programs were written in C and demonstrate basic programming concepts such as loops, conditions, user input, and algorithms. Files Included: hello.c â€“ Prints "Hello, world!" to introduce basic syntax. mario_less.c â€“ Prints a left-aligned pyramid using # bricks. mario_more.c â€“ Prints a right-aligned Mario-style pyramid. cash.c â€“ Calculates the minimum number of coins for change using greedy algorithm. credit.c â€“ Validates credit card numbers using Luhn's algorithm.

How to Run: 1. Make sure you have a C compiler (like GCC or use CS50 IDE). 2. Compile the file: gcc filename.c -o filename 3. Run the program: ./filename
