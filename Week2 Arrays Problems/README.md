# 💻 CS50x Week 2 – Arrays & Strings in C

This folder contains my solutions to the CS50x Week 2 problem set. These programs focus on **arrays**, **strings**, and basic **text processing** in C. They demonstrate techniques for manipulating characters, implementing ciphers, and analyzing readability of text.

## 📂 Files Included

- **caesar.c** – Implements Caesar’s cipher by rotating each alphabetical character using a user-provided numerical key.
- **substitution.c** – Encrypts messages using a substitution cipher with a key that is a permutation of the alphabet.
- **readability.c** – Calculates the grade level of a given text using the Coleman-Liau index.
- **scrabble.c** – Simulates a simple Scrabble scoring game that assigns point values to letters and determines which player wins.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., **GCC**) or use the **CS50 IDE**.
2. Compile the program using: gcc filename.c -o filename
3. Run the compiled program using: ./filename

## 📚 Note

These programs were built as part of the **CS50x 2025** course from Harvard University. Each task challenged my understanding of arrays, strings, loops, and logic in the C programming language.
