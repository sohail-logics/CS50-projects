# 💻 CS50x – Sorting, Elections & Text Processing in C

This folder contains my solutions to various **CS50x** problem sets.  
These programs cover concepts such as **sorting algorithms**, **election systems**, and **text processing** in C.

## 📂 Files Included

- **sort.c** – Analyzes a given C source file to determine which **sorting algorithm** (e.g., selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort) it implements.
- **plurality.c** – Simulates a **plurality voting** election where the candidate with the most votes wins.
- **runoff.c** – Implements a **runoff election** system where voters rank candidates in order of preference.
- **tideman.c** – Implements the **Tideman (ranked pairs)** election algorithm to determine a winner without ties.
- **Sort.txt** – Sample text or reference for testing the `sort.c` program.
- **README.md** – This file, explaining the purpose and usage of each program.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., **GCC**) or use the **CS50 IDE**.  
2. Compile the program:  
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o filename
  3 Run the compiled program:
./filename

## 📚 Note  
These programs were created as part of the **CS50x 2025** course from Harvard University.  
They involve implementing **election algorithms**, identifying **sorting techniques**, and working with fundamental C concepts such as **arrays**, **strings**, **structs**, and **loops**.
